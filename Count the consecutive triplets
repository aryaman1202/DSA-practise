# Given an array of distinct integers. The task is to count all the consecutive triplets such that sum of two elements equals the third element.

def countTriplet(arr, n):
    # code here
    arr.sort()
    p = 0
    a = 0
    cond = False
    for i in range(a, len(arr)-2):
        if (arr[i]+arr[i+1]) == arr[i+2]:
            p = p+1
        a = a+1

    return p


arr = [1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 15]
k = countTriplet(arr, 4)
print(k)

# Output: 3
